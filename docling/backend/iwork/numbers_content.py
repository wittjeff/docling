"""The content a Numbers document holds, however its container spells it.

Both container generations describe the same things — sheets of positioned
tables, charts and notes — so they are modelled once here and read into that
model by :mod:`docling.backend.iwork.numbers_iwa` and
:mod:`docling.backend.iwork.numbers_xml`. Turning the result into a
:class:`~docling_core.types.doc.DoclingDocument` is the backend's job, which is
what keeps the two readers from having to agree on anything else.

A spreadsheet cell holds a typed value rather than a string, and Numbers stores
it as one. Rendering happens here too, so that the readers agree on what, say,
``4650`` looks like even though one gets it as an IEEE double and the other as
an XML attribute.
