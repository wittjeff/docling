"""Reader for one packed cell of a ``TST`` table.

A table does not store its cells as messages. Each row of a tile carries them
packed into one buffer, and a cell inside it is a short header, a bitmask saying
which fields follow, and then those fields — so a cell has to be unpacked by
hand rather than walked like the rest of the object graph.

Apple has written two layouts of it, and both are still in circulation:

* **Version 5**, written since the 2017 release that changed how numbers are
  stored, describes itself: the bitmask says which of a fixed list of fields the
  cell carries, and they follow in that order. A numeric cell holds an IEEE
  754-2008 decimal128, which is why a spreadsheet no longer rounds 0.1 the way
  binary floating point would.
* **Version 4**, written before it, does not describe itself and is not written
  down anywhere. See :data:`CELL_FLAGS_OFFSET_LEGACY` for how it is read, and for
  the checks that make a misreading fail rather than return nonsense.

A document saved by a recent release carries both, and blanks out the version 4
copy it leaves behind for older ones, so the version 5 buffer wins wherever it is
there.
