"""Tests for the Apple Numbers (``.numbers``) spreadsheet backend.

Test Data Attribution
---------------------
``numbers_2013.numbers`` and ``numbers_iwork09.numbers`` are
``testNumbers2013.numbers`` and ``testNumbers.numbers`` from the Apache Tika test
corpus, licensed under the Apache License 2.0. They are genuine Apple Numbers
output and between them cover both container generations: ``numbers_2013``
stores its content as ``Index/*.iwa``, while ``numbers_iwork09`` uses the iWork
'09 ``index.xml`` layout. Both hold the same two-sheet checking register, so the
two readers can be checked against each other.

See https://github.com/apache/tika (``tika-parser-apple-module`` test resources).

The cell buffers in :func:`test_version_5_cell_storage_is_decoded` were captured
from Numbers documents saved by releases newer than either fixture, whose cells
use a storage layout the fixtures never exercise.
